# XmlSyntaxVisualizer UWP Sample

This sample shows how to use the [XmlParser](https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/XmlParser) library in C# to parse XML and map between the model and text (and back) within the [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) code editor within an UWP app.

It is based off of the suggested web-based sample found [here](https://github.com/garuma/XmlSyntaxVisualizer).

## Running the Sample

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2019
2. Set the build architecture to x64
3. F5 to deploy
